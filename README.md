## üìñ About

This repository houses my NixOS Linux ‚ùÑÔ∏è flake configuration, featuring the Hyprland window manager and adorned with the stylish Catppuccin Macchiato theme. I rely on this setup as my daily driver for work and programming, primarily in Rust ü¶Ä. Feel free to utilize it in its entirety or borrow specific components for your own configuration.

üö® It's essential to note that this configuration is not minimalistic or lightweight and may require some disk space and knowledge to understand. If you're looking for something simpler, this configuration may not be suitable for you.

This system leverages cutting-edge channels and versions of software to provide you with the latest updates and features. Notably, it utilizes:

- **flake** (An experimental feature of the Nix package manager)
- ~~**nur** (The Nix User Repository)~~ *currently disabled
- **nixpkgs**: unstable
- **rust**: nightly version

This approach ensures that you stay on the forefront of technology, receiving the most recent software advancements promptly. üö® However, it's important to note that this emphasis on bleeding-edge software may impact the stability of the system.

üö® Please note that the system utilizes **Podman** instead of **Docker** for containerization due to various reasons, primarily related to security (rootless and daemonless containers), easier migration to Kubernetes, availability of pods, compatibility with systemd, and better security for `distrobox`. If you prefer to use **Docker** instead of **Podman**, you can make the switch by commenting out the **Podman** section in the `nixos/virtualisation.nix` file and uncommenting the **Docker** section. More details on **Docker** configuration in NixOS can be found [here](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Docker).

The system also enables SELinux patches, as well as AppArmor and Tomoyo Linux Security Modules. It includes security daemons such as Fail2Ban and USBGuard, with Firejail preinstalled to meet your security requirements.

You have the flexibility to customize these configurations according to your needs by modifying the respective configuration files.
